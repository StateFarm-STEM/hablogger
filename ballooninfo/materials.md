| Buy	| Yes	| These are pricey but they are high quality	| 5Ft. High Altitude Balloon Parachute	| 1	| 55.5	| 55.5| 
| Buy	| Yes	| We need 2 minimum but I said 3 incase we need to have multiple payload boxes	| Recovery Shock Cord - 15'	| 3	| 11	| 33| 
| Buy	| Yes	| We need 2 minimum but I said 3 incase we need to have multiple payload boxes	| 4 Point Recovery Harness	| 3	| 23.5 | 70.5| 
| Buy	| Yes	| This can be used to reduce the distance the balloon travels so its not recovered hours away	| Weather Balloon Chute Release	| 1	| 140	| 140| 
| I've purchased	| Yes	| This is needed to inflate the balloon from the tank. It reduces the pressure down	| Weather Balloon Inflator	| 1	| 75	| 75| 
| Buy| 	Yes	| This sounds an alarm when the payload doesn’t move for a period of time. This helps to locate it in the field	| Alarm	| 2	| 13	| 26| 
| Back ordered | Yes	| used to monitor the flight. It will report on two different bands one long range once close. We can use Tri-Valleys until one comes in stock	| APRS Tracker	| 1	| 115	| 115| 
| Buy	| Yes |	These are for recording from the cameras	| SD Cards - 128gb	| 5	| 27	| 135| 
| Buy	| Yes - Until we run out | Used to seal the balloon	| zip ties	| 1	| 15	| 15| 
| Buy	| Yes	| Generic GoPro's for recording side video and one up to catch the balloon burst	| Action cams	| 3	| 119	| 357|
