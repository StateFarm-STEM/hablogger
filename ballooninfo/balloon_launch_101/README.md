# How To Launch a High Altitude BAlloon (HAB) For Carrying The Project

## Overview

## Prediction Details

### Burst Calculations

[SondeHub Burst Calculation Website](https://sondehub.org/calc/)

- Modify the fields with a red star for your needs:
  - Payload Mass is the weight of everything below the balloon you will be flying in grams. A simple [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=pounds+to+grams&oq=pounds+to+gram&aqs=chrome.0.35i39j69i57j0i512l8.4770j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) will yield the conversions
    - Rigging line(s), parachute, payload harness, Payload nd contents, and anything attached to the payload
  - Ballon Mass is the size balloon you will be flying. Be sure to select the proper size AND manufacturer. It's not a bad idea to validate the specs as we found the burst diameter a bit off.
  - Target Ascent rate in meters per second
    - For best camera results an ascent of 6 meters per second is optimal but you will likely need a different rate based on your lift gas volume
      - A flow gauge can be used to dial in the right amount of gas but they are typically cost prohibitive. These gauges are typically different for each type of gas as well.
    - You will need to modify this until the volume changes to your lift gas tank volume. A simple [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=cubic+feet+to+meters&sxsrf=APwXEdcz7Z9132iZwT_5k74WRE1ANWrVwA%3A1682485057227&ei=Qa9IZLvEDf-iptQP4aqroAg&ved=0ahUKEwj76LOh4cb-AhV_kYkEHWHVCoQQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=cubic+feet+to+meters&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBggAEBYQHjIICAAQFhAeEA8yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjoECCMQJzoHCAAQigUQQzoKCAAQigUQsQMQQzoNCC4QigUQsQMQgwEQQzoLCAAQgAQQsQMQgwE6CAgAEIoFEJECOgsIABCKBRCxAxCRAkoECEEYAFAAWP0kYKInaABwAXgAgAHIAYgB0BKSAQYxLjE4LjGYAQCgAQHAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) can convert m3 to cubic feet
   - Gas needs to be changed ot the lift gas you will be using. The calculations will be different for each lift gas option!

## Landing Prediction Calculator

[Sonde HAB Prediction Calculator](https://predict.sondehub.org/)

- Modify the fields with a red star for your needs:
  - Latitude and Longitude
    - You can use many tools like [maps.google.com](maps.google.com)
      - Find the location best suited for winds at launch time and place a waypoint. The latitude and longitude will be shown or copied easily from the shared link
  - Launch Altitude
    - THis can be determined with many tools like Google Earth, USGS, [websites](https://whatismyelevation.com/), etc
      - Be sure to convert to meters
  - Launch time UTC
    - [Convert](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+time+is+it+utc&oq=What+time+is+it+utc&aqs=chrome.0.35i39j0i512l9.2977j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) local time to UTC
- Launch Date
- Ascent Rate (m)
  - This was claculated fromt he above instructions on [SondeHub Burst Calculation Website](https://sondehub.org/calc/)
- Burst/Float Altitude (m)
  - This was claculated fromt he above instructions on [SondeHub Burst Calculation Website](https://sondehub.org/calc/)
- Descent Rate (m/s)
  - this will be defined by your parachute. Be sure you calculate based on the adjustments on your actual parachute as many can be reduced

## Supplies

### Launch site protection and tools 
- Tarp (This is for protecting the balloon from sharp objects and loosing items in the grass / dirt)
- Stakes for the tarp 9Handy to hold the tarp down in the breeze / wind)
- Gloves for anyone touching the balloon (Nitrile or cotton if using hydrogen. These protect the latex from oils in handlers skin)
- Stocking caps (these will protect the balloon form oils in hair especially in windy conditions when the balloon bounces off of everything)
- Lift Gas (Choose lift gas thats available, most common since helium shortages is hydrogen)
- Gas regulator (this is specific by gas type)
- [Balloon filler](https://the-rocketman.com/weather-balloon-inflator-2/)
- Safety Weight (Used ot secure the balloon while filling as a secondary safety as well as when unclipping from the tank and moving to a launch location)
- Tether - Tank to balloon (Can be tied from paracord and use a clip for quick detachment)
- Tether - Balloon to safety weight (Can be tied from paracord and use a clip for quick detachment)
- Duct tape (Used for attaching payload items, sealing payload, other misc needs. use a high quality tape like gaffers tape or Gorilla brand etc)
- Electircal tape (Used to cover sharp edges when zip ties are clipped. Also used to seal balloon neck to the filler tube)
- [Heavy Zip ties](https://www.amazon.com/Industrial-250-lbs-Strength-Electrical-Karoka/dp/B099PF1LMM/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=11A1R7BOUWGHK&keywords=heavy%2Bduty%2Bzip%2Bties&qid=1682489919&sprefix=heavy%2Bduty%2Bzip%2Btie%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-2-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzRUNQQUJJNUtYQUdSJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDYzMTY2UlZFSUY2V1dONVVQJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzMzgxMjIyU1NVT1NXSkRHR1FJJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1) (Used for sealing the balloon - do not skimp on these, buy 250lb)
- Zip ties light (handy for tasks like attaching antenna wire, payload trinkets etc)
- Wire Flush Cutters (Used to trim zip ties as flush as possible as well as cut antenna wire)
- Adjustable wrench for regulator (Used to attach regualtor to the gas bottle)

### Balloon and payload
- [Ballon](https://www.kaymont.com/product-page/hab-tx-1500) (Consider using the TX balloons for cold conditions)
- [Parachute](https://the-rocketman.com/recovery-html/) (4' is typically sufficient)
- [Shock Cord - Open Loop (2 - 12')](https://the-rocketman.com/weather-balloon-y-harness-and-shock-cord/)
- [Payload harness - 4 way open loop ](https://the-rocketman.com/weather-balloon-y-harness-and-shock-cord/)
- Payload boxes (Styrofoam coolers work well)

### Payload contents
- [Light APRS / WSPR tracker](https://qrp-labs.com/lightaprsw2.html) (This allows real time tracking using amateur radio. Note this requires a licensced operator)
- Batteries for tracker (4 AAA work well, consider lithium cells)
- Battery holders for tracker (4 cell holders in serial)
- [Battery pack for cameras and student data loggers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09H4GLZXT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (Any can be used jsut be sure to scale for your battery draw needs. These need to be inside the cooler or they will stop working at -10c)
- USB splitter cable (for powering cameras and data loggers)
- Cameras (action cameras similar to GoPro style cameras. Using generic brands will lesson the sting if the payload is lost. We have flown 4k 60fps units running about $140 each)
