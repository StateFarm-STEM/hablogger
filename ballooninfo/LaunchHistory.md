The High Altitude Balloon launch STEM program achieved its first successful flights without significant failures during this flight season.  Updated tracker code ensured the flight tracker would regularly send status message communicating it was alive, and 'fail safe' mode was incorporated.  It was with these launches the team learned the BME sensors, particularly the exterior mounted sensors, were vulnerable to static discharge from the styrofoam coolers.

Telemetry collected from these flights confirmed:
- Internal cooler temperature remained warm relative to lowest temps measures externally.  This confirmed a previous theory that the cameras generated ample heat inside the payload keeping the batteries sufficiently warm, avoiding the cutout zone starting around -30F.  The boosted confidence the cameras could be safely powered with large Lithium-ion battery packs.
- APRS flight tracker battery packs would safely power the tracker for at least one or two days on the ground.  Battery packs powering the flight trackers sending APRS telemetry data showed a drop of up to 0.25V during the flight.  Variance in the voltage was observed during the flight, with the voltage increasing briefly after launch.  This is believed to be due to the tempature changes internally or the change in impedenance load on the transmitter, but the exact reason is still unknown.
- APRS repeaters across the entire Midwest recieved and relayed telemetry packets send by the tracker.  200-300 mile diameter circle across the Midwest reaching Minnesota, Iowa, and Kansas while approaching max altitude.  The data on which repeaters recieved the packets appear to confirm the speculation the regions of highest gain radiated by the Moxon 2m antenna effectively 'projected a cone' down on earth -- the size of the cone increased as the payload attained higher altitudes.
